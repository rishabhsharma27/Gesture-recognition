Gesture recognition using CNN

Designed a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction and representation.

Applied L2 regularization to the convolutional and dense layers to prevent overfitting.

Utilized max-pooling layers for spatial downsampling and flattening layers to prepare data for classification.

Implemented a softmax activation function in the output layer for multi-class classification.
